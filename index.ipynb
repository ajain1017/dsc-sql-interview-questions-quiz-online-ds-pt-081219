    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "The four main datatypes are TEXT, INTEGER, REAL, and BLOB. Yes, you may use other types found in other kinds of SQL as SQLite3 is a dynamic version of SQL and is backwards compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "The primary key(s) of a table are those column(s) which uniquely identify a row. A foreign key is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table. A foreign key is a key used to link two tables together. A primary key-foreign key relationship defines a one-to-many relationship between two tables in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "A one-to-one relationship allows only one record on each side of the relationship. The primary key relates to only one or no record in another table. A one-to-many relationship allows a single record in one table to be related to multiple records in another table. The last many-to-many relationship allows many records in a table to be linked to many records in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "By default, a JOIN is an Inner Join. However, all the possible joins are:\n",
    "Left Join including intersection where intersection of the two tables is nonempty\n",
    "Left Join excluding intersection\n",
    "Right Join including intersection where intersection of the two tables is nonempty\n",
    "Right Join excluding intersection\n",
    "Full Outer Join including intersection\n",
    "Outer Join excluding intersection\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "The GROUP BY clause returns one row for each group and thus, for each group, you can apply an aggregate function such to provide more information about each group. If you were to use an aggregate function, you must order the data usually by using a group by statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "Associative Entity tables are used to indicate the associations between two seperate entities. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
